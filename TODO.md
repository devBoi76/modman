# TODO:
- [x] fix id conflicts with releases and more than one repository
- [x] fix dependencies with cfproxy
- [ ] improve the way of storing package indexes on the client to scale better
- [x] add some kind of namespaces and short names (?) i.e. `localhost->jei`, `another_repo.com->optifine`
	- [x] use Locators instead of IDs. Format is: `repository_url->package_name->release_id`
	- [x] make the server/cf proxy use these locators
- [ ] make modman "understand" game versions, i.e. it will know that snapshot 22w03a comes after version 1.7.10
- [ ] allow for adding system-wide repositories
- [ ] make it possible to install and generate MultiMC modpack manifests (?)
- [ ] create some kind of GUI client
- [ ] make `package.ts` and `util.ts` a library so the server can also use it without duplicating any code.
